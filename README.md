# Realtime Chat Application - Built with NextJS RSC & GraphQL

This repository contains the source code for a realtime chat application implemented using NextJS RSC (React Server Components) and GraphQL. This application is divided into two main sections: server (backend) and user interface (frontend).

# Installation

This project uses pnpm. Please follow the instructions on their website to install it if you haven't done so already.

## Installing dependencies with pnpm

You can install all dependencies by running:

```shell
pnpm i
```

## Installing dependencies with npm or yarn

If you're using npm or yarn instead of pnpm, you will need to manually install the dependencies in each folder.

For the server:

```shell
cd server
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

And for the UI:

```shell
cd ui
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

# Running the Application

## Running the server with pnpm

To start the server, run:

```shell
pnpm server:start
```

## Running the UI with pnpm

To start the UI, run:

```shell
pnpm ui:start
```

## Running with npm or yarn

If you're using npm or yarn, you can start each part of the application separately as follows:

For the server:

```shell
cd server
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

And for the UI:

```shell
cd ui
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Please ensure that both the server and UI are running to fully use the chat application.
